  <h1>Terms and Conditions for Donors</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Helping Hand application! Thank you for considering using our platform to connect with individuals seeking financial assistance. 
    Our aim is to create a transparent and direct way for you to make a difference. By using this app as a donor, you agree to the following terms and conditions:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Understanding Our Role:</strong> Our app, developed by Helping Hand group, acts as a bridge. We connect potential donors with individuals who have requested financial assistance. We facilitate the introduction and verification process as described in our app's information.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification Efforts:</strong> We strive to verify the identity of recipients and their requests, but our process has limitations. We cannot guarantee complete accuracy of every detail. The decision to donate is ultimately yours.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct Donation Model:</strong> This app does <em>not</em> handle, process, or transfer funds. All donations are made directly by you to the recipient using mutually agreed methods (e.g., bank transfer, mobile payment apps).</li>
    <li><strong>Your Donation Decision:</strong> Any donation you make is voluntary, at your sole discretion. You decide who, how much, and how you donate.</li>
    <li><strong>No Financial or Tax Advice:</strong> We do not provide financial, tax, or legal advice. Consult qualified professionals for guidance on your donations.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency and Usage of Funds:</strong> Recipients are encouraged to provide updates within the app on how funds are used. We promote transparency but cannot guarantee funds will be used <em>exactly</em> as described.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your information will be handled according to our Privacy Policy. Only necessary details may be shared with a recipient to facilitate direct donation.</li>
    <li><strong>No Fees:</strong> Helping Hand does not charge donors any fees for using this platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> Since we do not handle funds, we are not responsible for disputes between donors and recipients. We encourage clear communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> By using this app, you agree that Helping Hand group and its developers are not liable for any issues, losses, or damages arising from your decision to donate or recipient interactions.</li>
  </ol>
